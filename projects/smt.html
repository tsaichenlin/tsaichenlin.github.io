          Who's on First? is a baseball defense simulator web application
          created during the 2024 SportsMEDIA Technology (SMT) Data Challenge.
          Using raw data provided by SMT, our team filtered through the data and
          developed a model that assesses both individual and team defense. The
          model factors in each player's starting position and the dynamics of
          the entire lineup, delivering a precise and holistic evaluation.

        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>
          My primary responsibilities included designing the UI, building the
          web application, and integrating it with the backend server and model.
          Additionally, I contributed to idea generation and played a
          significant role in delivering the final presentation.
        </p>

        <p>Key Contributions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed the user interface and developed a prototype.</li>
          <li>
            Built a dynamic webpage and preprocessed user inputs before passing
            data to the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated the front-end web application with the back-end Flask
            server.

        <h1>Brainstorming Stage</h1>
        <p>
          We began this project with multiple brainstorming sessions to decide
          on the model and application we wanted to create. After many
          discussions, we chose to focus on evaluating the team's defense as a
          whole, where each player's stats influence the performance of their
          teammates. We also want to create a user-friendly application for
          coaches, players, and teams.

        <h1>Planning Stage</h1>
        <p>
          In order to produce a successful result, we planned out our projects
          and created checkpoints to keep ourselves on track. We also regularly
          met with SMT Data Challenge advisors to get feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is our Minimum Viable Product. We followed this plan to stay
          focused, prioritize critical features, and ensure we remained on track
          during the limited time available for the challenge.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600">Our Minimum Viable Product:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Model</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The model generates defense values influenced by the chosen
              players and their positions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pre-processing involves rough calculations of outs and innings to
              train the model and calculate runs.

          <li>Web Application</li>

              <li>Search for players to include in the lineup.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
              Users can simulate the lineup using the model and view the
              resulting defense metrics.

            <ul>
              <li>An evaluation report displays detailed defense results.</li>
              <li>
                Users can modify the lineup and resimulate, allowing for
                iterative improvements based on the model's feedback.

          We utilized React to build the front-end of our web application and
          Flask for the back-end server.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We chose React for the front-end due to its component-based
            architecture, which enabled us to build the application more quickly
            and efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            We used Flask for the back-end as it provided a lightweight and
            straightforward server to run the model.
