          Cakery is a logo and brand design project inspired by one of my
          favorite animalsâ€”bunnies.
          <strong>
            The goal of the project is to create a logo and brand identity
            centered around the charm and cuteness of bunnies.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The final design features an adorable logo that combines a cute bunny
          with a birthday cake. The elements in the logo are tweaked and
          integrated into various packaging designs to bring playfulness and joy
          to every aspect of the bakery. The soft color palette is carefully
          selected to evoke joy and create a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

        <h1>Foundation Work</h1>
        <p>
          Before beginning the design process, I researched rabbits to better
          understand their characteristics and physical appearance. This
          research allowed me to incorporate them effectively and creatively
          into the logo and brand design.
        </p>

        <p class="top-feature-description">
          Through sketching, I explored a range of logo styles and brand
          concepts. Ultimately, I chose to further develop Logo 12, as I loved
          how an upside-down bunny creatively resembles frosting drips on cakes.

        <p class="top-feature-description">
          After finalizing the rough logo, I began developing a brand around the
          idea of a local bakery. I envisioned myself as a bakery owner,
          crafting a brand that would be both joyful and welcoming for everyone
          in the community. With this vision in mind, I created the mood board
          below:

        <h1>Logo Iterations</h1>
        <p class="photo-description">
          Below are two of the iterations created in Illustrator. From the left
          logo to the right, I added horizontal bars to represent layers of the
          cake. This improved the readability of the logo as a cake.

        <h1>Final Logo Design</h1>
        <p class="photo-description">
          With more refinement and small changes, the final logo design was
          created! I swapped out the original circle with a flame to better
          represent a birthday cake and to evoke a sense of celebration and joy.
        </p>

        <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/cakery/Cakery Logo.jpg" />
        <p>
          The colors, soft pink and soft brown, were chosen to evoke a sense of
          love, playfulness, and warmth.

          After finalizing the logo, I tackled the package design by sketching a
          variety of potential packaging and merchandise for the brand. Using
          pencil and paper allowed me to explore limitless possibilities for the
          mockups.

          The final mockup showcases a variety of packaging that Cakery would

          type.
