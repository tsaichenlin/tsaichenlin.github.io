          Cakery is a logo and brand design project created through the prompt
          of
          <span style="font-style: italic; color: black"
            >Design an animal logo and develop a complete brand identity
            centered around this logo.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The final design features an adorable logo that combines a cute bunny
          with a cake, making it unique and memorable. The elements in the logo
          are tweaked and integrated into various packaging designs to bring
          playfulness to every aspect of the bakery. The soft color palette and
          design details are carefully selected to evoke joy and create a warm,
          welcoming atmosphere.

        <h1>Initial Appraoch</h1>
        <p>
          Due to the broad scope of the design prompt, I began by choosing an
          adorable bunny, one of my favorite animals at the time. I then
          researched rabbits to understand their characteristics and explored
          various shops, apps, and companies to determine how best to
          incorporate the bunny into the logo design.

          After sketching a variety of logos, I decided to further develop logo
          number 12. I believed that the combination of the bakery theme with
          the bunny was a perfect fit and that this design had great potential.

        <h1>Generating Brand Concept</h1>
        <p>
          Once the rough logo was confirmed, I began developing a brand around
          the idea of a local bakery. I envisioned myself as a bakery owner,
          crafting a brand that would be joyful and welcoming for everyone in
          the community. With this vision in mind, I created a mood board and
          then proceeded to finalize the brand's logo.

        <h1>Final Logo Design</h1>
        <p class="photo-description">
          Through more sketches and bringing the design to Adobe Illustrator,
          the final logo design was created! I incoperated a birthday cake
          specfically as it is symbol of celebration and joy. Through additional
          sketches and refinement in Adobe Illustrator, the final logo design
          was created!
        </p>

        <img class="img-shadow" src="../media/cakery/Cakery Logo.jpg" />
        <p>
          I incorporated a birthday cake specifically as it symbolizes
          celebration and joy. The colors, soft pink and soft brown, were chosen
          to evoke a sense of love, playfulness, and warmth. The brown accent
          also seamlessly blends with the bakery's baked goods.

        <h1 class="photo-description">Next – Package Design</h1>
        <p>
          After finalizing the logo, I tackled the package design by sketching a
          variety of potential packaging and merchandise for the brand. Using
          pencil and paper allowed me to explore limitless possibilities for the
          mockups.

        <p class="photo-description">
          The final mockup showcases a variety of packaging that Cakery would
          use, including bakery boxes, cups, bags, and aprons. Some designs
          feature the entire logo, while others incorporate elements of the
          logo, molding to the shape of each specific packaging type. The goal
          of the design is to create a cohesive and identifiable set of
          packaging that reinforces the brand’s identity and enhances the
          customer experience.
